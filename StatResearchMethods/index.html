<p><h1>BASICS OF STATISTICAL RESEARCH METHODS</h1></p>

<p> Before you dive deep into Descriptive Statistics, You should definitely start over with few terms that statistics revolve around. Trust me, it’s
going to be very simple! </p>

<p>So, how are you feeling today?  Or Are You Happy, Sad or
Angry?</p>

<p>When I asked you the first question, using the word “Feeling”,
answering was totally your call, you could’ve answered “meh” or anything you
wanted. There was no specific list or measure to it and in the statistic world,
it’s called a <b>“Construct” – Difficult to Measure.</b></p>

<p>When I asked you if you were feeling Happy, Sad or Angry, I
simply replaced the word feeling there and gave it a measurement (Gave an <b>Operational
Definition</b>) and now it’s no longer a construct but a variable with
different values. </p>

<p><b>POPULATION / SAMPLE </b></p>

<p>You know what?</p>

<p>There are 100 employees in the place I work and I talk only
to 10 employees every day. Statistically speaking, the <b>Population </b>of the
place I work is 100 <b>(all)</b> and the <b>Sample </b>size of the people I
talk to everyday is 10 <b>(some)</b>.</p>

<p>You also want to remember this – <b>PP, SS – Population Parameter,
Sample Statistic.  </b>Simply explained – all the 100 people (<b>Population</b>)
come into work at a mean time (<b>Parameter</b>) - 9.00 A.M and the 10 People (<b>Sample</b>),
I talk to everyday take their lunch break at a mean time (<b>Statistic</b>)
-1.00 P.M.</p>

<p>All I’m trying to say is, Parameter measures characteristics
of Population and Statistic measures characteristics of a Sample. </p>
	    
	    <p><img border=0 width=624 height=478 id="Picture 1"

<p>Samples are derived from the population and can be of
different sizes.</p>

<p><b>EXPERIMENTATION</b></p>

<p>I’m sure you know what an experiment is. When learning about
Statistical research methods, we must know the following two methods of
experiments.</p>

<p><b>Treatment: </b>As the meaning of the word itself, in this
method the sample is given treatments and the results are noted. Like testing medical
treatments by giving pills to a group of people and seeing the effects it has
on them. </p>

<p>The sample or the group that receives the treatment is
called the <b>Treatment Group</b>.</p>

<p><b>Observational Study: </b>Observing the sample as is
without giving any treatment. Like a survey, where the user fills out his/her
details. </p>

<p>The sample or group that receives no treatment is called the
<b>Control Group.</b></p>

<p>Now let’s say the control group in this case know people
from the treatment group and they discuss among themselves about how the pill is
working for them. Don’t you think there will be a chance of influence from
their friend making them say that the pill is working for them but, it is not? </p>

<p>Therefore, a Placebo is introduced. A <b>Placebo</b> is
something given to a control group so that they think they are getting the
treatment but, they are not. This way the control group become a fair measure
of baseline for the treatment group to be compared with. In this case, say a multivitamin
is given to the control group that’s looks exactly like the pill given to the
treatment group. </p>

<p>To make this a little more interesting, <b>Blinding</b>
technique is introduced to reduce bias in which the group doesn’t know who is
receiving which treatment. <b>Double Blinding</b> is where the one
administering the treatment as well as the group will not know who is receiving
which treatment.</p>

<p>Wasn’t that hard, right? Hope you had fun learning <span
